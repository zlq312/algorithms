   a. adult-stretch.data  Inflated is true if age=adult or act=stretch
   b. adult+stretch.data  Inflated is true if age=adult and act=stretch
   c. yellow-small.data   Inflated is true if (color=yellow and size = small)
   d. yellow-small+adult-stretch.data  Inflated is true if 
            (color=yellow and size = small) or (age=adult and act=stretch)
